# Repeato CLI Step

<!-- [![Step changelog](https://shields.io/github/v/release/bitrise-steplib/steps-avd-manager?include_prereleases&label=changelog&color=blueviolet)](https://github.com/repeato-qa/bitrise-repeato-cli-step.git/releases) -->

Run repeato recorded tests in bitrise workflow.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

Run repeato tests on a virtual Android or IOS device. Once some basic inputs are set, the Step checks the requirements, downloads the workspace before executing the tests.

### Configuring the Step
1. Add the **Repeato CLI** Step to your Workflow as one of the Steps in your Workflow.
2. Set the **Workspace Repo** to pull a repeato workspace tests. Fow now only git repos option is supported for workspaces setup.
3. Set the **Batch Id**. The batch id to execute the specified Batch tests.

Please make sure [AVD](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/avd-manager) or IOS emulator is ready and configured properly according to the workspace tests. Your android/ios app build must be installed on the emulator before this step. 
You must configure the AVD with according to your local emulator on which repeato workspaces tests were recorded.

### Troubleshooting
The emulator needs some time to boot up. The earlier you place the Step in your Workflow, the more tasks, such as cloning or caching, you can complete in your Workflow before the emulator starts working.
We recommend that you also add **Wait for Android emulator** Step (in case of android) to your Workflow as it acts as a shield preventing the AVD Manager to kick in too early. Make sure you add the **Wait for Android emulator** Step BEFORE the `Repeato CLI Step` so our step can use **AVD Manager** or **IOS Emulator**.
